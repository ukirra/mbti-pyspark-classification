# üß† MBTI Classification with PySpark & HDFS

This project classifies MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) personality types based on user-generated text using **PySpark**, featuring an NLP pipeline, multiple machine learning models, and distributed storage via **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**.

---

## üì¶ Dataset

Two MBTI datasets from Kaggle were used:

- [MBTI Type Dataset (Datasnaek)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/mbti-type)  
- [MBTI 500 Dataset (Zeyad Khalid)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeyadkhalid/mbti-personality-types-500-dataset)

Each dataset contains user posts along with their MBTI personality type (e.g., INFP, ENTJ).
